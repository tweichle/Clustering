**Goals**

- Using MLB Statcast Metrics, summarize and examine baseball statistics.
- Build a k-Means Clustering model to predict clusters using exit velocity and launch angle as features.
  - Determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method and silhouette coefficients.
- Build a Hierarchical (Agglomerative) Clustering model to predict clusters using exit velocity and launch angle as features.
